# Where does Playwright fit into this testing mindset?

Playwright, in my mind, has two main purposes:

1. Unit testing on web pages when these components aren't part of a server-side suite.
2. Smoke tests on existing websites, especially testing for accessibility. 

We will be looking at the first method here, but I feel like both options are equally important.
