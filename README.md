# Playwright Caffeine Break

This is a repository that has some examples of Playwright. This is for the 9/15/2023 Caffeine Break for University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana. 

The slide deck is in the /slides folder. [The first slide is the title](./slides/title.md).

There are two demos. The first demo is the introduction at Playwright. The second one is this project, which you can pull down and run using VS Code and Live Server. The npm command for Playwright is stubbed out. This project also has speaker notes.
