            <h1>Some details about Playwright</h1>
            <details>
                <summary data-testid="test-subject">
                    Local web server
                </summary>
                <p data-testid="test-information">This can access your own web server by updating the playwright.config.js. Note that you need to have an NPM command; you can create a stub if you are using LiveServer.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>
                    Existing website
                </summary>
                <p>You can point to an existing website and run the tests. Good for final verification and regression tests.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>
                    Uses both javascript and typescript
                </summary>
                <p>I'm using javascript because I'm more familiar with this. However, this is typescript-enabled. Most examples are in typescript.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>
                    Can generate screenshots
                </summary>
                <p>This is useful to get visual tests. Recommend only using this as needed and as small of an area as possible, because this takes a while to run</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>
                    Can run accessibility tests
                </summary>
                <p>Integrates with aXe toolkit to give you all the accessibility options</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>
                    Can interact with the page
                </summary>
                <p>You can use this to test how your website runs (uses <a href="https://playwright.dev/docs/locators">Playwright Locators</a>). Can choose by the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Role</li>
                        <li>Text</li>
                        <li>Title</li>
                        <li>Test ID</li>
                        <li>CSS or XPath selector</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>All of these have their plusses and minuses. If possible, I would focus on the Test ID methodology.</p>
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>
                    Has "pre" and "post" steps that can be run on suites
                </summary>
                <p>You can use this if your tests require you to log into a page or run steps for setup</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>
                    Can be run using NPM or NPX
                </summary>
                <p>The NPM option is important because you can trigger this automatically using a Github CI/CD. This can be run on demand (very useful if you are doing this on an existing server) or on code checkin.</p>
                <p>Note that if you are doing this, you need to install this on a temp server or use another tool like vite.</p>
