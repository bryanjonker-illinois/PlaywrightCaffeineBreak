            <h1>Types and Definition of Tests</h1>
            <h2>What types of tests are there?</h2>
            <p>Better minds have come up with this answer. Here are some links:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing">Wikipedia Software Testing article</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.browserstack.com/guide/types-of-testing">Browser Stack</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/software-testing/types-of-software-testing">Atlassian</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Where does Playwright fit into this testing mindset?</h2>
            <p><a href="https://playwright.dev/">Playwright</a>, in my mind, has two main purposes:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>It allows unit testing on web pages when these components aren't part of a server-side suite. PHP, .NET, Java all have their unit test framework, but you can't run their unit tests on pure JavaScript.</li>
                <li>Overall smoke tests and monkey tests on existing websites. It doesn't matter what the website was coded in, Playwright can test it. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>We will be looking at the first method here, but I feel like both options are equally important.</p>
            <h2>Can Bryan get on his soapbox on <em>xxxxxxx-driven development</em>?</h2>
            <p>Of course he can!</p>
            <p>Test-driven development was explained to me as "you write tests first," but I feel it is more than that. We all do some type of xxxxx-driven development, with the xxxxx being <em>what we care about.</em> How we code is literally driven by that X. Do we care that it works? Do we care that it can be tested? Do we care that it is accessible? Do we care that it is easy to use? What xxxxx-driven development does is it names what we care about, and it says that when we build a project, we are focusing on that piece.</p>
            <h3>Follow up question. Is it OK not to care?</h3>
            <p>Of course. We all are busy and not all projects matter equally. <a href="https://xkcd.com/2730/">Obligatory XKCD comic.</a> Some things we will spend a lot of time on and it will never get used. Others will have a life of their own. We do our best.</p>
